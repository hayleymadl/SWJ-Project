# Writing to Johnson: Violence in Correspondence, 1763-1764

Born in 1715 in Ireland, Sir William Johnson immigrated to the North American colonies in 1738.[^ref1]  Settling in the Mohawk Valley approximately twenty-five miles west of Schenectady, New York, Johnson rapidly developed his skills and influence first as an Indian trader and later as a diplomat to the various Indigenous nations in the northeast. After the close of the French and Indian War in the colonies, Johnson was made Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the North. In this position, Johnson served as the key mediator between Euroamericans and Indigenous peoples, handling everything from trade and land disputes to holding treaty councils. Consequently, Johnson produced a vast amount of paperwork not only during his time as Superintendent, but even beforehand as a private citizen and a military leader during the war.

This correspondence is largely kept in the collections of the New York State Library, but the most comprehensive print source of such documents is the 14-volume series *The Papers of Sir William Johnson*, published from 1921 to 1965. While Johnson’s correspondence has been vital to the study of Indigenous people in the 18th century, as well as other aspects of the colonial period such as empire in the New World, colonial expansion, and diplomacy, it has never been dedicatedly studied in and of itself. 

The project *Writing to Johnson: Violence in Correspondence, 1763-1764* examines the extent of violence during Pontiac’s War, an Indigenous uprising from 1763 to 1765. Though the French and Indian War ended in the colonies by 1763, the period was not peaceful. Over the course of 1763 and 1764, many Indigenous nations unhappy with France and England after the war such as the Odawa, Ojibwe, Shawnee, and Delaware engaged in the conflict that has become known as Pontiac’s War or Pontiac’s Rebellion. This led to many individual or more intimate instances of violence across the colonies, rather than descriptions of formal warfare. As one of, if not the most unified instance of Indigenous resistance to European rule during the colonial period, Johnson and his Indian agents were key players during this time and discussed its many issues in their correspondence. 

Pontiac’s War has the lingering reputation of being a particularly violent and bloody conflict as a united front of Indigenous nations laid siege to and seized nine out of 14 forts along the frontier.[^ref2] Tales of “Indian savagery” raced across the frontiers and to major communication centers, and many of these tales remained in the public memory as time wore on—regardless of their authenticity. As Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Johnson was a key figure during this conflict and its events passed frequently through his communications. By utilizing Volume IV of *The Papers of Sir William Johnson*, this project reexamines the lethality of Pontiac’s War along the frontier through the eyes (or words, rather) of one of the men involved from the beginning. By using Johnson’s correspondence as its main source, *Writing to Johnson* not only challenges the bloody reputation of Pontiac’s War, but studies Johnson’s communications in and of themselves to evaluate how far his network reached into the backcountry and how reliable correspondence was during the eighteenth century. In this way, *Writing to Johnson* combats narratives of inevitable decline that hinge on Indigenous peoples “validly” losing their lands during periods of violence like Pontiac’s War. As many of these arguments are based on acceptable retaliation to supposed Indigenous brutality, Johnson’s correspondence proves a key source in correct such narratives.
